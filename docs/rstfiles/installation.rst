Installation
============

You should be able to get the latest version of the gp package from github.::

    git clone https://github.com/exord/gp gp

This should create a new directory named gp. Make sure to add it to your PYTHONPATH.

To get a stable realease (e.g. v1.0), you can do::

    git clone --branch v1.0 https://github.com/exord/gp gp


In the future, we expect to add this package to the Python Package Index and installation through ``pip`` should be trivial.
